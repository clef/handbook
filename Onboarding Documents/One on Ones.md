# One on Ones

Every week, every member of the Alegion team meets with their manager in an open ended meeting that lasts at least thirty minutes. The agenda for the one on one is set by the employee and its primary intention is to build a trusting relationship. This is not a status check-up or performance evaluation, it’s dedicated time where the manager is available to hear what each member of their team is excited or frustrated about, what is blocking or scaring them, and what’s going well or could use improvement.

Trust is the fundamental currency of teams, and these meetings are the easiest place to earn trust. Managers are making time for every direct report, every week, so that they build an individual relationship with each one and establish a reliable channel for communication.

## Scheduling

One on ones should be a recurring calendar event at the same time every week, but the schedule is meant to be regular, not rigid. The meeting can be moved if another event is happening at the same time or if the team member feels like they need more time on a given week. The important thing is that the manager makes it a priority to find time for the meeting.

Making time for one on ones helps every team member feel like their manager cares about the relationship with them and that their manager is prioritizing their needs.

## Agenda

Agendas for different one on ones can vary widely, but this is the team member’s meeting, so they should have ultimate control. One on ones should be a mix of present problems/resolutions and future goals/plans. What is blocking today and how can it be resolved or worked around? What do you want the future to look like, and what are the concrete steps you’ll take to get there?

One on ones are also a good place to give and receive feedback. Talk about what’s working well and why it’s particularly effective. Ask what you can be doing better and where the team can improve.

Managers should probe throughout the meeting. Ask follow up questions, dig deeper, and restate complicated ideas to make sure you understand correctly. This is an invaluable time to learn, and you’ll earn more trust by listening than by talking.

## Following Up

It’s useful to take notes during the meeting, so that you can ask about how things have changed in the future. It’s also useful to take notes during the week -- if you notice something that you’d like to talk about, a note will make sure you address it in your next one on one.

If an employee is having a problem with a coworker, make sure to ask before you intervene. In some cases, intervention will make the complainant’s work situation worse. Always defer to their needs and aim for their goal for resolution.

When you do act, remember to follow up and talk about the resolution. This gives you a chance to show that you take their problems seriously and also opens the opportunity to talk about the potential causes of the problem and how to avoid them in the future or improve the way they’re handled.
