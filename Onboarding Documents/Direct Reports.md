# Direct Reports

Everyone who works at Clef should report to Mark, Jesse, or B. The goal of this relationship is to provide support and guidance to the employee -- this is the person they will talk to about their goals, meet with regularly, and go to first with questions. We are not doing any official performance reviews yet, but this is also the relationship where employees will get feedback on how they are doing and areas where they can improve.

These relationships are one to one and are not meant to divide the company into teams. Though we certainly have distinct business functions, we should all try to operate as a single unit wherever possible. At this size, Clef’s organization doesn’t need to go any deeper than this first level, so everyone should feel as if they are on even footing.
