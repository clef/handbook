The length of leave will be up to 4 months or the equivalent number of days the employee would normally work within the 4-month period.  Intermittent leave or a reduced work schedule may be taken.  Employees should give notice to the founder to whom they report.

Paid bereavement leave will be granted up to three consecutive days for the death of a family member including the following:  spouse, domestic partner, cohabitant, child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, grandparent, great grandparent, brother or sister.


## Jury Duty or Witness Summons

Employees will be granted time off to serve on a jury or as a witness.  In order to minimize disruption in the office, employees are requested to check in with the founder to whom they report when jury duty or witness testimony lasts less than four hours per day and may be requested to work remotely.  A copy of the jury duty or witness summons and all associated documents must be presented to the founder to whom you report as soon as reasonably possible.

## Other Leaves of Absence

Josephine will grant leaves of absence for other activities as required by law.  Unless otherwise required by law, employees will not be paid for such leaves of absence.
