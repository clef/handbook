# Josephine Meal Credit

Appreciating amazing food and love that it represents is a core part of working at Josephine. 

While our team is small, each employee will have unlimited credit to use towards personal consumption of Josephine food! The goal for this benefit is to help our employees remain intimately familiar with the community we serve and the experience we provide. Meal credit should be used for meals that employees are able to pick up in-person. 

We will be tracking employee credit use for the first year of implementation, and will likely re-evaluate policy as the team grows.
