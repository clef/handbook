# Josephine Meals

Attending meals, engaging our community and appreciating good home cooking are are core part of working at Josephine. 

While our team is small, each employee will have unlimited credit to use towards personal consumption of Josephine food! Because connecting with cooks and customers keeps us rooted in our work, we encourage employees to use credit primarily for meals that they are able to pick up in-person.
