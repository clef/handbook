# Josephine Meals

Attending meals (to engage our community and appreciate amazing food) is a core part of working at Josephine. 

While our team is small, each employee will have unlimited credit to use towards personal consumption of Josephine food! Because connecting with cooks and customers keeps us rooted in our work, we encourage employees to use credit primarily for meals that they are able to pick up in-person. 

We will be tracking employee credit use for the first year of implementation, and will likely re-evaluate policy as the team grows.
