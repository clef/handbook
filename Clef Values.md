#Clef Core Values

##Be better today than yesterday.

Being better is more important than being the "best", because "best" means complacency and better means progress. We are always improving. Improvement requires reflection, so we take ownership of our mistakes and question our habits.

##Treat others the way they'd like to be treated.

Our customers and teammates have different needs from our own, so we must consider their  perspectives to communicate effectively. We work best together when we empathize with one another, and we create the best product when we understand the people we are building for.

##Fight the default of exclusion.

Inequality and exclusion are the defaults of our industry. Without intentional effort, we will inherit those failings and worsen the problem. Building a diverse team is a moral imperative and we build a better business and product by bringing different perspectives to the table. We look for voices unlike our own because they are the only ones that help us grow.

##Build trust with truth.

Transparency and honesty are requirements for succeeding with Clef. In order to build a trusting community we give employees and customers deep visibility into how decisions are made and easy outlets to help guide our course. When we build trust through good communication, we create an environment for better communication in the future.

##We succeed together.

We fight for Clef because we love the problems we solve and the people we work with. We are most excited when the company’s successes are our own, and when our teammates recognize our contributions. When we’re excited, the hard work we do always has meaning.
