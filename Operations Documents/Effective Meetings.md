# Effective meetings and group work

To increase flexibility in how and where employees at Clef work, we agree on a shared set of constraints for group work and meetings. 

## Meeting Ettiquette

### Meetings start on time

If you're leading a meeting, it's your responsibility to start the meeting on time. If you're attending a meeting, you are responsible for showing up on time.

### Meetings happen in regular hours

All team members should make themselves available for face-to-face meetings between 10:30am-1:00p Pacific Time, as long as they are scheduled at least 24 hours in advance. If a meeting needs to happen outside of these hours, the meeting organizer should scheduled it a week in advance. 

### Meetings should have a video option

If you're hosting a meeting with a remote worker invited, it's your responsibility to provide a video link before the meeting starts for them to join. 

If you're attending a meeting remotely, you should join the video call before a meeting starts. It's your responsibility to ensure this is possible — this means being in a quiet place with a fast internet connection before the meeting starts. Calling into a meeting via phone or from a public place is unacceptable.

For some meetings, voice calls will be sufficient - this decision is up to the meeting organizer when they create the meeting.

### Prerequisites for successful meetings

The following things are pre-requisites for successful group work:

* A fast, reliable internet connection. Remote employees should make all efforts to mitigate video call lag.
* A quiet place to take meetings

If you're planning to work with another person on the team (i.e. for a meeting during meeting hours or to pair program), you should make sure these are available.
