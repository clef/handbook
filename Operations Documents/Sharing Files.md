# Sharing Files at Josephine

## Base Directories

At the base of every member of the Josephine team’s directory, there should be 6 directories:

1. **[Josephine Handbook](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bwj0rVaUQUXPNWI3SmlwMXRkTDQ&authuser=0)** -- a collection of documents about how we do things at Josephine, which anyone can comment on

2. **Active Projects** -- All project folders will be shared globally in this folder

3. **Inactive Projects** -- projects which aren’t currently under development

4. **Resources** -- common resources which will be shared across projects -- like logo design resources, press clippings, etc.

5. **OKRs** -- everyone at Josephine’s objectives and key results.

6. **[Your Name]** -- every employee should have their personnel folder in the root directory with contracts, offer letters, etc. inside (shared only with you)

## Creating New Projects

When a new project is started, a folder should be created with the format:

	**Project Name**

in the Active Projects folder so that it will be shared with everyone else on the team.

When the project is complete or paused, it should be moved to the Inactive Projects folder and labeled with the date when it was archived with the format:

**YYYY-MM Project Name**

The current structure doesn’t have a lot of built-in support for teams, since each project is autonomous. This will probably need to be fixed later as we grow and divide our functions into teams.
