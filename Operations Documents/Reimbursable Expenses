# Expenses and Reimbursement

Act in Josephine's best interests. 

In general, business expenses that you incur as a direct result of doing your job are reimbursable by the company. 

Please submit expenses via email to our accountants, copying your manager (who will be responsible for approving). Include photos of receipts for as many line items as possible and ensure you keep receipts for any purchases over $25.
