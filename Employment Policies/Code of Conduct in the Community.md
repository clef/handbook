#Code of Conduct

Our community is dedicated to creating an inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, or computing experience (or lack of any of the aforementioned).
We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Harassment does not need to be recognized as unwanted or unwelcome by anyone other than the person being harassed.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Offensive jokes are not appropriate and will not be tolerated under any circumstance.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Community members violating these rules may be sanctioned or removed from community spaces. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact B (b@getclef.com) or one of the other founders immediately.

We expect community members to follow these rules in all Clef-related communities (including but not limited to IRC, support chat, the Clef Community Slack group, Twitter, and Facebook) and at all Clef-related social events.
