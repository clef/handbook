#Salary and Equity Compensation

The following policy will apply to compensation offers for the first 8 employees at Josephine after the founding team. After we have hired 8 additional people, we will likely revise the salary rubric and equity amount.

##Salary

Fair compensation is critical to making Josephine a desirable place to work and helping our employees lead happy, healthy lives inside and outside of the office. When used as a motivational tool, though, it can incentivize the wrong kind of optimizations. Our goal with salary is that it checks the box of "enough" for folks who are excited about working at Josephine (because of the mission, community, and opportunity for growth) and then fades into the background.

Traditional salary negotiations are also heavily biased because they rely on individual gut feelings and negotiation. This favors candidates who come from more privileged backgrounds and are afforded more confidence during the hiring process.

To avoid that bias, and to better align motivations, we have a standard rubric that determines all employee salaries. Everyone in the company falls into one of four options based on their job description and years of past experience as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Years Experience</td>
    <td>Technical</td>
    <td>Non-Technical</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>More than 5 Years Experience</td>
    <td>$120k</td>
    <td>$100k</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Between 2 to 5 Years Experience Experience</td>
    <td>$100k</td>
    <td>$70k</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Less than 2 Years Experience</td>
    <td>$80k</td>
    <td>$55k</td>
  </tr>
</table>


We count experience as any time doing the same category of job at a company similar to Josephine (such that the experience is relevant to the job being offered at Josephine).

The offer also comes with the option to take $5k less salary in exchange for ~.05% more equity (to be revised after any updates to our valuation).

At the beginning of each year (in January), we will adjust this rubric to make sure it stays at market rate.

##Equity

Every employee will be offered 85,714 stock options (~.75% of outstanding shares, including the option pool these are drawn from). As mentioned above, they can also choose to reduce their salary by $5k/year in exchange for 5,714 more options (totalling ~.05% of outstanding shares).

Employee equity vests over 4 years with a 1 year cliff.
