# Acknowledgement of Receipt of Changes to the Employee Handbook

I acknowledge I have received a copy of the changes to the Josephine Employee Handbook that will take effect on **DATE**, have read them, and understand their provisions.  I further understand that if I have a question, I am obligated to ask one of the founders for clarification of any provisions in the Employee Handbook.

I further understand that the statements contained in the handbook do not create any contractual or other legal obligations of employment.  I also understand that Josephine may at any time modify, rescind, or revise any policy, benefit, or practice described in the handbook, except for its policy of at-will employment.

I acknowledge that it is my responsibility to read and become familiar with the contents of the handbook.
