# Acknowledgement of Receipt of Employee Handbook

I acknowledge I have received a copy of the Josephine Employee Handbook, have read it, and understand its provisions.  I further understand that if I have a question, I am obligated to ask one of the founders for clarification of any provisions in the Employee Handbook.

I further understand that the statements contained in the handbook do not create any contractual or other legal obligations of employment.  I also understand that Josephine may at any time modify, rescind, or revise any policy, benefit, or practice described in the handbook, except for its policy of at-will employment.


I understand and agree that my employment with Josephine is at-will and can be terminated by either me or the company without cause or notice and that nothing in the handbook should be interpreted to the contrary.  This is the entire agreement between me and Josephine on this subject; it supersedes any prior inconsistent representations or agreements and may only be modified in a writing signed by me and the CEO.


I acknowledge that it is my responsibility to read and become familiar with the contents of the handbook.
