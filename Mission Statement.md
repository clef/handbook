# Mission Statement

Our mission is threefold: 

## Labor: 
To create more inclusive opportunities in food for people who need it the most - stay at home mothers, immigrants, and people of underrepresented minority groups. Cooking is the most fundamental lever of economic empowerment, and the food industry has taken that away through its strict barriers to entry. 
## Food Justice: 
To increase access to healthy food options, specifically in areas suffering from issues like food deserts. Home cooking can empower healthy decision-making in communities that haven’t had the privilege of nutritional education - the appeal of home cooking exists across all cultures & geographies. Home cooking also allows for the decolonization of ethnic foods by making sure that cooks and communities are directly benefiting from their own food and culture. 
## Tech Equity: 
To contribute to a more diverse and inclusive tech culture. Our platform serves everyone from ESL immigrants to mothers and retirees— not all of whom have computers or are comfortable with smartphone apps. We try to not only lead through example, but also to acknowledge and mitigate our displacing effect through support of initiatives and organizations that are building a more inclusive tech ecosystem.

## The Labor Mission: 
We serve the cooks. Food is not just a commodity, it’s a relationship. The industry has been quick to flaunt cheaper, bigger, faster, but says little about the livelihoods of the people in the kitchen. We believe that food is a labor of love and that food quality is directly connected to the health and well-being of the person that has prepared it. 
Cooks have drawn the short straw in an industry that sees food as a commodity and labor as a cost to be marginalized. We need more than just calories to survive, and that’s why we see food 
The Food Justice Mission: Cultivate trust. Let communities help themselves. “The cornerstone of our work is the belief that food enterprises should be owned and/or controlled by the local communities that depend on them.” Local food entrepreneurs live/work/play among people in their communities and we believe that they are best-suited to nourish them as well.—We we trust thatthem to feed their people the best they can.

## The Technology Mission: 
Inclusive technology.
